# ESP-CF
![Logo of ESP-CF](https://github.com/Pepe-57/esp-cf/blob/main/esp-cf_logo.jpg)
A custom firmware(before os) that is designed for ESP8266. Written in MicroPython. ESP-CF is __completely free__ to use. The previous name 'ESP-OS', has been updated to 'ESP-CF' to better reflect it as a custom firmware rather than a full-fledged operating system. 'ESP-CF' stands for '__ESP Custom Firmware__'. 
### !THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED! [NEW VERSION HERE](https://github.com/Pepe-57/esp-os)
